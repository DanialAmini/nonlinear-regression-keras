# NON-LINEAR REGRESSION WITH KERAS

This repository focuses training the neural networks for regression and continuous value prediction.

## Theory

We all know about classification like cats vs dogs! However, regression sounds more mysterious than classification.. 

The main difference between regression and classification algorithms that regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc. and classification algorithms are used to predict/classify the discrete values such as male or female, true or false, spam or not spam, etc. and that's all actually!

The figure is given at below will make your mind clearer about the regression! Yes, this figure is awesome! :)

**Types of ML Classification Algorithms:**

Classification algorithms can be further divided into the following types:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Kernel SVM
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

**Types of Regression Algorithm:**

Regression algorithms can be further divided into the following types:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
