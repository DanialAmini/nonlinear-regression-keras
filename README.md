# NON-LINEAR REGRESSION WITH KERAS

This repository focuses training of a neural network for regression using "Keras". Please check [this medium post](www.medium.com) for all of the theoretical and practical details!

## Quick Summary

In this study, we've used "[the yacht hydrodynamics data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yacht+Hydrodynamics)" as a case study and we've reached 0.99 R-square value which is awesome! The approaches and codes that shared in this tutorial can be adopted for any other regression tasks such as "[computer hardware](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Computer+Hardware)", "[energy efficiency](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency)" and more!
